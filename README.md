# StackOverFlow-Survey-2017
I have used data from StackOverflow 2017 Annual Developers Survey, to get a closer look at the questions. This survey conducted on many developers and contains over 64,000 reviews, from all over the world.

# Installation
There should be no libraries necessary to run the code here after anaconda is distributed to Python. The code should work without problems using Python versions 3.
# Project Motivation
For this project, I was interestested in using Stack Overflow data from 2017 to better understand:

* <span style='color:darkslategray'> **Does Job Satisfaction affected by salary and the service period in the company ?**
